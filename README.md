## Project Scope:
The school board is looking to understand various performance metrics for the different schools in the district. 

## Challenge:
The school district discovered that the ninth grad students at Thomas High School were incorrect, and they need to have the files updated. The grades would be updated with NAN.

# Summary:
 The top schools are all Charter schools that are smaller in size then the District schools. The district needs to look at this due it seems like students at the larger schools are slipping through the cracks nd not getting the education they could be. This is harmful to the schools, the students, and could really impact how well the students do in their life.
